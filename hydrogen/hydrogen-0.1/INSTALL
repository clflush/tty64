	Hydrogen LKM
	------------

		Inorder to use Hydrogen, the kernel must be compiled with module support.
		To check if your kernel supports modules just try to execute 'lsmod' and
		if no errors been generated it's safe to assume it is.

		To compile Hydrogen simply type 'make all', afterward you should see a file
		called 'hydrogen.ko' to activate type 'insmod hydrogen.ko', and to deactivate
		you should type 'rmmod hydrogen', while Hydrogen is activated you should
		see it's entry in 'lsmod' output
