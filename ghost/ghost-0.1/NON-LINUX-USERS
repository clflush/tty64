I'm not sure how much portable this code is.

If you manage to run this code on anything else but Linux, let me know. I've tried it once on FreeBSD and it didn't work
to due GNU Hashtable API (which is __USE_GNU extensions in my case) and it seems to be not so common/implemented after all.

Porting this code to another OS's rather than Linux isn't made it to my TODO list. However i would kindly accept 
any patch's or suggestions on how to make this code more cross-platform and portable.
