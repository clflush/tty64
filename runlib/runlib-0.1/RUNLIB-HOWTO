RUNLIB-HOWTO
------------

	Runlib is the Linux equivalent of Windows 'rundll32' utility with a few tweaks. In other words it allow you execute functions 
	from shared libraries without coding a single line in C, all from your favorite shell.

SYNTAX
------

	Runlib syntax is somewhat similer to Windows rundll32. It require a library name (or full path) then the function name and
	afterward a list of arguments to pass along. The library name lookup method relays on system linker and you should make sure
	that the full library path is in the '/etc/ld.so.conf' and ldconfig has cached it. otherwise use the full path instead.

PARAMTERS TYPES
---------------

	There are two ways of passing parameters to a function, By Value methods means to pass the value itself while By Ref
	means to pass a pointer to the value which is basically a pointer. Depends on the function prototype and usage you should
	make sure that parameteres are passed in the right order and type. By default the program would assume everything 
	is By Val and in Hexdeicmal base using the double quotes (eg. "") would make sure that the given data would be passed
	as pointer. Also notice that By Ref quotes are being explicty pushed (eg. \") as most shells interpreted double quotes
	as a String. This by itself is very useful when one wants to pass a String (eg. char *) as a parameters.

EXAMPLES
--------

	"Hello World Example"
	---------------------

		root@magicbox:~# ./runlib libc.so.6,printf \""Hello World"\"
		(11)
		root@magicbox:~#

	"Where is Wolldo?"
	------------------

		root@magicbox:~# ./runlib libc.so.6,strstr \""Where is Waldo\"" \"Waldo\"
		(0xbfb6d989) [Waldo]
		root@magicbox:~#

	"Advance Printf"
	----------------

		root@magicbox:~# ./runlib libc.so.6,printf \""Hello %s, I am %d years old\"" \"World\" 0x5
		(29)
		root@magicbox:~#

	"Printf w/ Buffering"
	---------------------

		root@magicbox:~# ./runlib libc.so.6,printf \""Hello %s, I am %d years old\"" \"World\" 0x5
		(29)
		root@magicbox:~# cat printf.stdout ; echo
		Hello World, I am 5 years old
		root@magicbox:~#

	"Size does matter"
	------------------
	
		root@magicbox:~# ./runlib libc.so.6,strlen \""Welcome to New York city and have a nice day\""
		(44)
		root@magicbox:~#
