INSTALL
-------

	This program using the 'Runtime Linker Library' which should be installed by default. The supplied Makefile in this package
	by default assume you trying to compile this program on Linux which requires to include the '-ldl' during the compiltion.
	However to the best of my knowledge in *BSD it's not require and might cause compile errors. In that case a slighty modifiction
	in the Makefile is required (eg. remove the '-ldl' from LIBS tab)

	You should type 'make all' and if everything goes as planned you should have an executable named 'runlib'
