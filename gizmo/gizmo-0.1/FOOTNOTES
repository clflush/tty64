	* The INT 3h Gizmo is implemented in a way that it's hijack the SIGTRAP HANDLER RET address and resume flow from it. I have my doubts 
	  about how smart this trick can be, since i didn't take the time to proper study the way Linux Kernel handles such events.
	  It might put the entire program in a very unstable position (?) ;-)

	* The PTRACE Gizmo is using PTRACE_TRACEME which can not be disabled during runtime. In additon to the INT 3h Gizmo if the PTRACE would
	  run perior to the INT 3h it would cause bizzare side effects since the SIGTRAP signal caught by the PTRACE. You should keep it the 
	  other way around (1st INT 3h , 2nd PTRACE) if you wish to combain the two of 'em in the same ELF.

	* The Encryption gizmo is a very basic one. I didn't put any magic hash to verify the password against. In other words it would try to 
	  decode the .TEXT section anyway and if the password is incorrect it would still jump to it and most likely would hit a SIGSEGV

	* The Assembly garbage generator isn't based on any smart algorithm. Just a little bit randomize junk 

	* Once you pad your ELF with generated assembly garbage. You can no longer append any Gizmo's to it!
